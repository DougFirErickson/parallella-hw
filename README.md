PARALLELLA: Supercomputing for Everyone
========================================	

This repository contains open source board and FPGA designs associated with the Parallella project. 

## Board Files
The Parallella board is open source hardware. The table belo

Board      | Description
-----------|--------------
[parallella-gen1](boards/parallella-gen1)         | Parallella Kickstarter board currently in production
[porcupine](boards/porcupine)                     | Breakout board 
[parallella-template](boards/parallella-template) | KiCad template board for creating daughter cards  
[parallella-gen2](boards/parallella-gen2)         | The next Parallella board (work in progress...)

## FPGA Sources
The table below contains links to some of the key blocks used by the Parallella. The complete source tree can be found in "fpga/src"
